# v2.1 updates.
### Saturday, March 20, 2021.
Today I was able to start planning the updating and new features for version 2.0. I will be implementing Agile with the scrum framework for this version.


# v2.2 mentors and apprentice.
I will work on getting the Mentors account working. I need figure out how this is going to work with the apprentice users. The question is show update the current model or show I create a new model for mentors. I also need to figuer out the relationships between the apprenticed and mentors.
